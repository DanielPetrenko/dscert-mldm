##Textbook and class materials

We will be using [Compeau, P. and Pevsner, P., Bioinformatics Algorithms, An Active Learning Approach. Active Learning Publishers, La Jolla, CA, 2014.]({{ site.book_url }})

This text book is accompanied by a set of video lectures that you can view in preparation for class discussion during class meeting times. [Video playlists are available on youtube]({{ site.book_videos_url }})

**Class meeting times will (for the most part) not be lecture time**. The goal is to use class time to explore Biological and Algorithmic aspects of materials in depth and collaboratively with your peers.

Programming exercises and problems are integrated with the
	textbook readings and videos. We will use the
	[Rosalind Project](http://rosalind.info) to manage programming
	exercises and submissions. More information below.

Other links:

  - We will use Piazza for official discussion and announcements:
	[{{ site.piazza_url }} ]({{ site.piazza_url }})  
  - All other class business will be done on elms:

##Syllabus

The [official syllabus](syllabus.html) details class policies and grading information.

##Class prep

The [Course Calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}/index.html) will list
readings (usually from [the textbook]({{ site.book_url }}), on
occassion uploaded to [Canvas]({{ site.canvas_url }})). **You are
required to read this material before lecture**

The [Course Calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}/index.html) will also
list programming exercises to **attempt** before lecture. You
will upload attempted solutions to the [pre-lecture exercise
Rosalind page]({{ site.rosalind_prelecture_url }}).

The [Course Calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}/index.html) will list
any quizzes or written assignments to be completed before lecture. You
must submit these assignments **before lecture** as instructed.

##Programming projects

Programming exercises on the [final submission
Rosalind page]({{ site.rosalind_final_url }}) will be collected into
*programming projects*. Some additional analysis using the programs
you write for these exercises will be assigned. Those additional
analysis will be submitted as instructed. Full descriptions of the
programming projects will be posted in the
[Programming Projects course
page]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects.html).

##Written assignments

Some written exercises will be assigned covering material we
have discussed in class. These will be posted on the
[Course Calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}/calendar.html) and announced on
the class [Piazza page]({{ site.piazza_url }}). This includes in-class exercises
that may not necessarily be announced ahead of time. See the [syllabus](syllabus.html)
for class policies on attendance.

##Announcements and discussion

We will use the [Piazza page]({{ site.piazza_url }}) for class
announcements. Please use the [Piazza page]({{ site.piazza_url }}) for
class discussion. Note that the Rosalind Project class pages also have
disucssion capability. **Do not use it**, please use the
[Piazza page]({{ site.piazza_url }}) for *all discussion*.

##Participation grade

The [course grading scheme](syllabus.html) includes a class participation grade. You can earn full credit for this in three ways: (1) lecture participation, asking questions and answering your peers quesitons, (2) piazza participation, asking and answering questions on piazza, (3) regular attendance to office hours. To earn full credit you should aim to ask or answer a question at least once every two weeks on lecture or on piazza; or attend office hours at least once a month (that can include just going to my office hours to chat about computer science, biology, science, etc.)
