*   Textbook information:
	We will be using
	[Compeau, P. and Pevsner, P., Bioinformatics Algorithms, An Active Learning Approach. Active Learning Publishers, La Jolla, CA, 2014.](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/)

	This text book is accompanied by a set of video lectures that you
    can view in preparation for class discussion during class meeting times.
	[Video playlists are available on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/bioinfalgorithms/playlists)

	**Class meeting times will (for the most part) not be lecture
      time**. The goal is to use class time to explore Biological and
      Algorithmic aspects of materials in depth and collaboratively
      with your peers.
	  
*   Programming exercises and problems:
	Programming exercises and problems are integrated with the
	textbook readings and videos. Problems are defined and solutions
	submitted in the class'
