title: Midterm 2 Guide
---

**Midterm II is on Tuesday Nov. 10, at class time**
*
The midterm exam will consist of: ~6-10 quick questions (multiple choice, true/false), ~5 short questions, 1 or 2 longer questions.

It will cover the following material (this is not an exhaustive list, there may be material, especially from
the sequence comparison chapter, that is not listed here, that may be included in the test):

1.	Biological sequence comparison: Why do we need algorithms that find inexact alignments between biological sequences (e.g., DNA, aminoacid, RNA)? Why are exact matching algorithms (like the pattern finding algorithms we saw in the first couple of weeks of class) not sufficient for biological questions?  

2.	Sequence Assembly. The Hamiltonian and Eulerian approaches to sequence assembly (complexity and tradeoffs). Paired-end sequencing. The effect of repeats and sequencing error on graph-based assembly approaches. High-level understanding of Lander-Waterman statistic for sequencing coverage requirements of genome assembly.    
3.	Sequence comparison. Dynamic programming algorithms: Global alignment (Needleman-Wunsch), Local alignment (Smith-Waterman). Linear gap penalties, affine gap penalties. The probabilistic
interpretation of scoring matrices (as log odds of two probabilistic models). Formulating inexact alignment algorithms as finite state machines. Divide-and-conquer algorithm for linear-space global alignment. Very high-level understanding of the multiple sequence alignment problem.
