title: Midterm 2 Guide
---

**Midterm II is on Monday Nov. 24, at class time**
*
The midterm exam will consist of: ~6-10 quick questions (multiple choice, true/false), ~5 short questions, 1 or 2 longer questions.

It will cover the following material (this is not an exhaustive list, there may be material, especially from
the motif finding chapter, that is not listed here, that may be included in the test):

1.	Biological sequence comparison: Why do we need algorithms that find inexact alignments between DNA or aminoacid sequences? Why are exact matching algorithms not sufficient for biological questions?  

2.	Sequence Assembly. The Hamiltonian and Eulerian approaches to sequence assembly. High-level understanding of Lander-Waterman statistic for sequencing coverage requirements of genome assembly.    

3.	Inexact Alignment. Dynamic programming algorithms: Global alignment (Needleman-Wunsch), Local alignment (Smith-Waterman). Linear gap penalties, affine gap penalties. The probabilistic
interpretation of scoring matrices (as log odds of two probabilistic models). Formulating inexact alignment algorithms as finite state machines. How to do global alignment with linear space complexity?  


4. Peptide sequencing. What are peptides? What is a peptide's mass spectrum? What is the cyclospectrum peptide sequencing problem? Given an observed experimental spectrum, and a peptide, what is the difference between scoring as a linear vs. cyclic peptide?
