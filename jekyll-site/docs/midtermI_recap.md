title: Midterm 1 Guide
---

**Midterm I is on Thursday Oct. 8th, at class time**

The midterm exam will consist of: ~6-10 quick questions (multiple choice, true/false), ~5 short questions, 1 or 2 longer questions. You can bring one (1) 8.5x11 (lettersize) piece of paper to the exam.

It will cover the following material (this is not an exhaustive list, there may be material, especially from
Chapter 1, that is not listed here, that may be included in the test):

1.	Molecular Biology concepts. Most questions will be about term/concept identification, possibly a short question to
test your understanding of basic molecular biology processes: e.g., replication, transcription, translation.  

2. Programming for Bioinformatics. What are the types of entities commonly encapsulated by data
structures in bioinformatics libraries? What is the importance of reproducibility in the analysis of
genomics data?  

3.	Bioinformatics Resources. Quick questions of to check your ability to identify resources containing specific types of data. E.g., genomic sequences may be found in refseq, sequencing experiments in the Short Read Archive.  

4. Motif finding. What are transcription factors? What are motifs? What is the motif finding problem (biologically and computationally)? What is a _profile_? What is _entropy_, and why should we use it to score motifs? Why should we score motifs? How is motif finding an optimization problem?  In Gibbs sampling, what is the benefit of randomly selecting a starting point for a given sequence instead of choosing the starting point that maximizes probability?  

5.   Clustering. What is the general clustering problem (assuming gene expression, or other continuous measurements/features). What is the k-means algorithm? What is the objective function minimized by the k-means algorithm? What is the soft k-means formulation and what is its relationship with the randomized algorithms used in motif finding.  

6. General algorithmics. What is an exhaustive algorithm? What is a greedy algorithm? What is a randomized algorithm? For each of these, what are appropriate ways of analyzing the correctness and performance (running time) of these algorithms.
