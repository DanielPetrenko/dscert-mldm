**Question 1.** Construct the **suffix trie** for string `abbaaba$`.

**Question 2.** Indicate the path taken to search for a match of pattern `baab`.

**Question 3.** ($k$-mer counting) Design an algorithm using a suffix trie to output, for a given string $S$ and integer $k$, **all** pairs $(b,i)$ where $b$ is $k$-mer occurring in $S$ exactly $i$ times.

**Question 4.** Construct the **suffix tree** for the same string and indicate path to search for `baab`.

**Question 5.** Construct the **suffix array** for the same string.

**Question 6.** Same as Question 3, but use a suffix array.
