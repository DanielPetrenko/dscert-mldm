**Question 1.** What is the score of this global alignment for strings `canon` and `gannon` with parameters: $\textit{match}=2$, $\textit{mismatch}=-1$, $\textit{gap}= -5$.  

\texttt{cano-n}  
\texttt{|||| |}  
\texttt{gannon}

**Question 2.** How would I set parameters $\textit{match}$, $\textit{mismatch}$ and $\textit{gap}$ to solve the LONGEST COMMON SUBSEQUENCE PROBLEM?

**Question 3.** Calculate an optimal global alignment for strings `canon` and `gannon`
with the same parameters as question 1. Show DP table (donâ€™t
need to fill scores in completely), indicate path for resulting alignment, and write the final alignment.

**Question 4.** (a) Would we get the same answer with mismatch penalty
-10? (b) Would we get the same answer with mismatch penalty -100?
(c) What is the smallest mismatch penalty that gives alignment in (b)?

**Question 5.** What is the score of this local alignment, with the same parameters:

\texttt{an-on}  
\texttt{|| ||}  
\texttt{annon}
