% CMSC 423 Project IV: Classification, clustering and HMMs

Part I: Create a CpG Island classifier

Extract cpg and non-cpg island sequences from one human chromosome, train
a Markov model for CpGi and non-CpGi. Run it on another chromosome, compare
with "truth".

Part II: Create a CpGi HMM

Implement an HMM CpGi state machine, compare to estimate from part I.

Part III: Implement k-means for expression data. 

1) Do feature selection
2) Cluster genes.
