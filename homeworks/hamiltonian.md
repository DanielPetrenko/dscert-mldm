**Question 1.** Solve the string reconstruction problem for this set of eight 3-mers:

$$
\{\mathtt{AGT,AAA,ACT,AAC,CTT,GTA,TTT,TAA}\}
$$

Construct the graph with 8 vertices corresponding to these 3-mers (string overlap, Hamiltonian path approach) and find a Hamiltonian path (7 edges) which visits each vertex exactly once. Does this path visit every edge of the graph? Write the reconstructed string corresponding to this Hamiltonian path.

**Question 2.** When using the string overlap approach, why would a pair of reads corresponding to non-overlapping positions in the genome have an edge connecting them?
