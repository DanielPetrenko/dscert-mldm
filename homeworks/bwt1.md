**Question 1.** Construct the **suffix array** for string `abbaaba$`. Use 0-based indexing.

**Question 2.** ($k$-mer counting) Design an algorithm using a suffix array to output, for a given string $S$ and integer $k$, **all** pairs $(b,i)$ where $b$ is $k$-mer occurring in $S$ exactly $i$ times.

**Question 3.** Compute the Burrows-Wheeler transform of string `abbaaba$`.

**Question 4.** Write down the occurrence count matrix (LF mapping matrix) for the BWT you computed in Question 3.
