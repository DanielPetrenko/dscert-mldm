**Question 1.** Calculate an optimal global alignment for strings `canon` and `gannon`
with parameters: match 2, mismatch -1, gap -5. Show DP graph (donâ€™t
need to fill scores in completely), indicate path for resulting alignment, and write the final alignment.

**Question 2.** (a) Would we get the same answer with mismatch penalty
-10? (b) Would we get the same answer with mismatch penalty -100?
(c) What is the smallest mismatch penalty that gives alignment in (b)?

**Question 3.** Calculate an optimal local alignment for the same strings with the
Same parameters as Problem 1. Show DP graph and final alignment.
